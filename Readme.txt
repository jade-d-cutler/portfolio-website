== Jade Cutler Portfolio Website

Description: 
This website was made so that I could display my projects, skills, and a link to my GitHub. 

Functionality:
At the top if the page is a greeting inside a carousel. You can click the GitHub buitton to be brought to my account. You can also click my resume button to be brought to my Overleaf.com resume. 
You can scroll through the web page to see all the contents. Once at the bottom there is a scrollup button that can be clicked to bring you to the top again.
At the bottom of the page is my contact information and a contact form. 
The contact form isn't fully functional, I just wanted to display that I could add a form and make it functional if needed.
